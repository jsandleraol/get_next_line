# get_next_line @ 42
This project is the final starting project before branching out. The goal is to
make a function which reads a single line from a file descriptor, assuming it
isn't being tampered with in between calls to the function.

It must fit in one source file and one header. Mine works with multiple file
descriptors. It also has no memory leaks (hurray)!
